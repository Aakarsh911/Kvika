## Product summary
Kvika is a unified productivity workspace for software engineers. Work shows up in Slack, Gmail, Jira, and Calendar, but the action often needs to happen somewhere else — tasks fall through those gaps.

## Key capabilities
- AI reads your inbox and Teams messages and extracts action items with priority and due dates
- Gmail and Outlook in one inbox; Google Calendar and Outlook in one calendar
- Team scheduling without back-and-forth email chains
- Focus blocks that survive daily reshuffles
- Ask Kvika: type what you need and run actions across email, Jira, and calendar
- Integrations: Google, Microsoft, Jira, Slack, GitHub

## How it works
1. Connect Google, Microsoft, and Jira via OAuth
2. Calendar, email, tasks, and team messages sync incrementally
3. Gemini extracts action items from your inbox in batches
4. One workspace for your whole day — calendar, mail, tasks, focus time

## Beta access
Private beta with weekly invite rollouts. Join the waitlist at ${siteUrl}/waitlist
