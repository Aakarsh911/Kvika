      <P>
        You read an email at 9:04 AM. Someone asks for a review, a bug fix, or a doc update. You
        mentally note it, archive the thread, and move on. By 3 PM it is gone — not because you are
        careless, but because email was never designed to be a task queue.
      </P>
      <P>
        Software engineers feel this harder than most roles. Jira holds sprint work. Slack holds
        urgent pings. Email holds everything else: security reviews, vendor questions, cross-team
        asks, and calendar invites with hidden homework. The result is a slow leak of commitments
        that never make it into a system you actually check.
      </P>

      <H2 id="why-inbox-fails">Why your inbox is a bad task manager</H2>
      <P>
        Inboxes sort by recency, not priority. An urgent but low-importance message pushes a
        important-but-not-urgent ask off the first screen. Stars and labels help until you have
        forty starred threads and the signal collapses again.
      </P>
      <P>
        Email also mixes <em>reference</em> with <em>action</em>. A thread might contain context you
        need next week and a single sentence that requires a response today. Keeping the whole
        thread “unread” clutters your view; archiving it hides the action.
      </P>
      <Callout type="info">
        The fix is not “inbox zero” discipline. It is separating <strong>capture</strong> (what
        landed) from <strong>execution</strong> (what you do today).
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="patterns">The three places tasks hide</H2>
      <H3>1. The polite ask buried mid-paragraph</H3>
      <P>
        “When you get a chance, could you take a look at…” does not create a Jira ticket. It creates
        guilt. These are the highest-leak category because they feel optional until someone follows
        up two weeks later.
      </P>
      <H3>2. The forwarded thread with no owner</H3>
      <P>
        “Looping you in here” often means you are now responsible, but nobody said that explicitly.
        Without a due date or acceptance, the task floats.
      </P>
      <H3>3. The calendar invite with implicit prep</H3>
      <P>
        “Design review Thursday” assumes you read the attached doc, the linked Figma, and the prior
        thread. The meeting is on the calendar; the prep work is not.
      </P>

      <H2 id="system">A system that actually sticks</H2>
      <P>
        The lightest-weight system that works for most engineers:
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>1. One capture pass per day.</strong> Scan inbox and Teams for action verbs: review,
        approve, fix, send, schedule, follow up. Do not process — just capture.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>2. One task list with due dates.</strong> Every capture gets a date, even a rough one.
        “By Friday” beats “eventually.” If it takes more than two minutes to define, it is a real
        task, not a note.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>3. Link back to source.</strong> Each task should open the email or thread it came
        from. Context switching is expensive; rebuilding context from memory is worse.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>4. Calendar blocks for deep work.</strong> Tasks without time rarely happen. Put focus
        blocks on the calendar the same way you put meetings there.
      </P>

      <H2 id="ai-extraction">When AI helps (and when it doesn't)</H2>
      <P>
        Manual capture works but breaks on busy weeks. AI extraction — reading batches of email and
        surfacing action items with suggested priority and due dates — reduces the daily triage tax.
      </P>
      <P>
        It works best when you stay in the loop: review suggestions, edit titles, reject noise. AI
        should propose tasks, not silently create fifty false positives. It fails when treated as
        fully autonomous or when it cannot link back to the original message.
      </P>
      <P>
        That is the problem Kvika is built around: Gmail and Outlook in one place, AI-suggested
        tasks with source links, and a calendar that knows when you actually have time to do the work.
      </P>

      <H2 id="next-steps">What to do this week</H2>
      <P>
        Pick one day and run an honest audit: search your inbox for “can you”, “please review”, and
        “following up”. Count how many are not in Jira, not on your task list, and not on the
        calendar. That number is your leak rate.
      </P>
      <P>
        Then pick one capture habit — daily pass, AI assist, or a shared team rule that every ask
        in email gets a ticket — and run it for two weeks before adding complexity.
      </P>
